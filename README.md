# Resource Task Network Demo

This is a demo on how to use the RTN model for process scheduling in a batch chemical plant.

## Model
See model equations in the Markdown at the top of each of the .ipynb files (Note: Github Markdown doesn't support LaTeX yet for me to show the formulas here)

## Example System
### System Being Modeled

1 reactor can perform three different stoichiomentric reactions (50/50 ratio for reactants):
- Reaction 1: A + B -> D
- Reaction 2: A + C -> E
- Reaction 3: B + C -> F
